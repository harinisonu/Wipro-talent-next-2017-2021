Day 3 Programs:

***********************************************************************************************************************************

1)

Is Even?
Write a function to find whether the given input number is Even.
If the given number is even, the function should return 2 else it should return 1.
Note: The number passed to the function can be negative, positive or zero. Zero should be treated as Even.

2)

Is Odd?
Write a function to find whether the given input number is Odd.
If the given number is odd, the function should return 2 else it should return 1.
Note: The number passed to the function can be negative, positive or zero. Zero should NOT be treated as odd.

3)

 Return last digit of the given number
Write a function that returns the last digit of the given number.
Last digit is being referred to the least significant digit i.e. the digit in the ones (units) place in the given number.
The last digit should be returned as a positive number.
for example,
if the given number is 197, the last digit is 7
if the given number is -197, the last digit is 7

4)

 Return second last digit of the given number
Write a function that returns the second last digit of the given number.
Second last digit is being referred to the digit in the tens place in the given number.
for example,
if the given number is 197, the second last digit is 9
Note1 - The second last digit should be returned as a positive number.
i.e. if the given number is -197, the second last digit is 9
Note2 - If the given number is a single digit number, then the second last digit does not exist. In such cases, the function should return -1.
i.e. if the given number is 5, the second last digit should be returned as -1

5)

 Sum of last digits of two given numbers
Rohit wants to add the last digits of two given numbers.
For example,
If the given numbers are 267 and 154, the output should be 11.
Below is the explanation -
Last digit of the 267 is 7
Last digit of the 154 is 4
Sum of 7 and 4 = 11
Write a program to help Rohit achieve this for any given two numbers.
The prototype of the method should be -
int addLastDigits(int input1, int input2);
where input1 and input2 denote the two numbers whose last digits are to be added.
Note: The sign of the input numbers should be ignored.
i.e.
if the input numbers are 267 and 154, the sum of last two digits should be 11
if the input numbers are 267 and -154, the sum of last two digits should be 11
if the input numbers are -267 and 154, the sum of last two digits should be 11
if the input numbers are -267 and -154, the sum of last two digits should be 11
