Day 2 Programs:

*******************************************************************************************************************

1)

Write a Java Program to accept 25 integer elements for an array then find the maximum number in the set and display it.

2)

Design an algorithm to accept 10 integer elements for an array and then find the number of times the number with the maximum value occurs in the array. 
For Example – If input elements are: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 9, 3, 4, and 2 Output must be 2 
Reason: The number with the highest value in the array is 9. It occurs 2 times in the array.

3) 

Design an algorithm to calculate the factorial of a number N. The value of N is provided as an input by the user.

4) 

Design an algorithm to accept a given string from the user. The algorithm must then remove characters from the string which appear more than once. 
For Example – If input string is – Malayalam
 The output must be – maly

5) 

Design an algorithm to find the least perfect square, which is divisible by each of 21, 36 and 66.
